<h1><h1 style="font-family:Verdana; color:blue; text-align:center;">All About me!</h1>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:center; color:purple;">Welcome to my webpage! My name is Meghana Shastri and I created this webpage as an introduction to who I am.</p>

<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:center; color:purple;">I am 17 years old and my height is 5 feet and 2 inches. I live in Sammamish, Washington. I go to Skyline High School, and I am going to be a senior next year. I play tennis, and I do Indian classical dance. When I'm not busy with schoolwork or with extracurricular activities, I like to listen to music, watch anime/tv/movies, and sleep. I am also vvery passionate about food, as it is an art form that is underappreciated. I dislike a lot of things as well, such as corruption, hypocrites, crime, and celery. I HATE celery with a passion. Some fun facts about myself include that I have been to 22 countries, I am bilingual, and that I lived in India for four years. Below are a few links to my favorite pages.

<p><img src="side_scroller.jpg" alt="Side Scroller Game: The Floor is Lava" style="width:400px;height:400px;"><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:center; color:purple;">This summer, I am enrolled in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Last week, I experimented with scratch, and I created a side scroller game called the floor is lava. Below is a screenshot of what the game looks like: </p>
<h2><h2 style="font-family:Verdana; color:blue;text-align:center;">What I've learned in Python so far:</h2>
<h3><h3 style="font-family:Verdana; color:red;text-align:left;">Conditionals:</h3>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">Conditionals give an output based on an input by the user. In python, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>
    if user_input == "yes":
    	print (X)
    elif user_input == "no":
    	print (Y)
</pre>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">On Scratch, it looks like this:</p>
<img src="scratchconditional.jpg" alt="example of a conditional on scratch" width="128" height="128">
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:right; color:purple;">A real life analogy of the conditonal is when you decide to act nice to a person if they are nice to you. If they aren't nice, then you won't be nice to them (because that's how people behave)</p>
<h3><h3 style="font-family:Verdana; color:red;text-align:left;">Variables:</h3>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">Variables store information. Usually this means you have defined something in a programming language, and the information is stored in the form of either boolean, string, or integers. An example of a string variable in Python looks like this:</p>
<pre>
	y = 8
</pre>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">On Scratch, it looks like this:</p>
<img src="variablescratch.png" alt="example of a variable on scratch" width="128" height="128">
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">A real life analogy of a variable is you percieving that there are 6 apples in front of you, and you store that information in your brain, and that information isn't changed unless you percieve something else later on </p>
<h3><h3 style="font-family:Verdana; color:red;text-align:left;">Function:</h3>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">Function is the process of performing a certain task. An example of a function in Python looks like this:</p>
<pre>
	print ("words")
</pre>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">On Scratch, it looks like this:</p>
<img src="functionscratch.png" alt="example of a function on scratch" width="128" height="128">
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">A real life analogy of a function is when someone tells you to say something, and you do that. </p>
<h3><h3 style="font-family:Verdana; color:red;text-align:left;">Loop:</h3>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">Loop is used to repeat actions a certain amount of times. An example of a loop in Python looks like this, where range is the word that repeats actions:</p>
<pre>
	for x in the range (10)
    	sum = sum + x
        print sum
</pre>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">On Scratch, it looks like this:</p>
<img src="loopscratch.jpg" alt="example of a loop on scratch" width="128" height="128">
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;">A real life analogy of a loop is when someone tells you to run a lap around the track field and repeat that 4 times. You are doing the same task, but it's repeated.</p>
	
<h2><h2 style="font-family:Verdana; color:blue;text-align:center;">What I've learned in Javascript so far:</h2>  
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; text-align:left; color:purple;"> I've started learning another language called Javascript, and it is used to program the behavior of web pages. Below on the left is an example of what Javascript can do, and it reveals script when clicked, and the button on the right hides that script. Click the buttons to see/hide the script.</p>
<p id="demo" style="display:none">Hello JavaScript!</p>
<button type="button"> <button style="text-align:center;"                   onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'">Click Me!</button>
<button type="button"> <button style="text-align:center;" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='none'">Click Me!</button>
<p id="demo" style="display:block"> The date can also be displayed using Javascript. Click the button to see what the current date is!
<p> <script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
  </script> </p>
<button type="button"><button style="text-align:center;"                   onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'">Click to see what the date is!!</button>
<button type="button"><button style="text-align:center;"                   onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='none'">Click to hide the date.</button>	
</body>
