<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"><p style="text-align:center;"><p style="color:purple;">Welcome to my webpage! My name is Meghana Shastri and I created this webpage as an introduction to who I am.</p>
<p><p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"><p style="text-align:center;"><p style="color:purple;">I am 17 years old and my height is 5 feet and 2 inches. I live in Sammamish, Washington. I go to Skyline High School, and I am going to be a senior next year. I play tennis, and I do Indian classical dance. When I'm not busy with schoolwork or with extracurricular activities, I like to listen to music, watch anime/tv/movies, and sleep. I am also vvery passionate about food, as it is an art form that is underappreciated. I dislike a lot of things as well, such as corruption, hypocrites, crime, and celery. I HATE celery with a passion. Some fun facts about myself include that I have been to 22 countries, I am bilingual, and that I lived in India for four years. Below are a few links to my favorite pages.

Last week, I experimented with scratch, and I created a side scroller game called the floor is lava. Below is a screenshot of what the game looks like:
